🌍 Supporting Multilingual Learners Has Never Been This Easy — Or This Free.

In this video, I walk you through how AlloFlow — a completely free, open-source AI classroom assistant — helps teachers and families support English Language Learners (ELLs) and multilingual students with instant, high-quality differentiation.

Unlike Google Translate overlays, AlloFlow generates materials *natively* in the target language at the point of creation. That means your math problems, reading passages, glossaries, and activities are linguistically authentic — not awkwardly machine-translated after the fact.

🔑 What You'll See in This Video:
• Instant translation of generated reading passages into 100+ languages
• Side-by-side bilingual text for scaffolded comprehension
• Multilingual glossary generation with AI-created images
• Word Sounds Studio: phonemic awareness activities that work across languages
• How the "Bridge Mode" generates content natively in a student's home language
• Accessible text-to-speech (TTS) in the student's chosen language

💡 Why This Matters for Your Classroom:
→ ELL students receive materials in their home language without extra teacher prep time
→ IEP-aligned accommodations for multilingual students are generated in seconds
→ Families can practice at home using the same tools teachers use in class — for $0
→ No student data is uploaded — everything stays local on the device (FERPA-friendly)

🏗️ Built by an Educator, for Educators
AlloFlow was designed by a school psychologist who understands that multilingual learners deserve more than a Google Translate layer on top of English-only content. Every feature is designed with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) at its core.
