# AlloFlow: The $26,000 Question
### A One-Pager for District Decision-Makers

---

## The Problem

Your teachers are juggling 5-7 different EdTech subscriptions:
- **Text leveling** (Newsela, Diffit)
- **Gamified quizzes** (Kahoot, Quizizz)  
- **Interactive lessons** (Nearpod, Pear Deck)
- **Accessibility tools** (Read&Write, Immersive Reader)
- **Reading assessment** (Amira, Literably)
- **AI content generation** (MagicSchool)

**Annual cost for a typical school site: $20,000–$30,000**

Each tool requires:
- Separate login credentials
- Separate training
- Separate data policies
- Separate renewal negotiations

---

## The Solution

**AlloFlow** is a single, open-source platform that combines all six categories.

| Capability | Typical Tool | Typical Cost | AlloFlow |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Text Leveling | Diffit | $3,000/yr | ✅ Included |
| Gamification | Kahoot | $3,000/yr | ✅ Included |
| Interactive Lessons | Nearpod | $5,000/yr | ✅ Included |
| Accessibility Suite | Read&Write | $4,500/yr | ✅ Included |
| Oral Fluency Assessment | Amira | $3,000/yr | ✅ Included |
| AI Content Generation | MagicSchool | $5,000/yr | ✅ Included |
| **TOTAL** | | **~$26,000/yr** | **$0** |

## Why It's Free

AlloFlow is licensed under **AGPL v3** (the same license as Linux).

- No subscription fees
- No per-seat licensing
- No "freemium" upgrade pressure
- The code is public and auditable

**The catch?** There isn't one. This is a genuine open-source project built by educators, for educators.

## Privacy & Compliance
