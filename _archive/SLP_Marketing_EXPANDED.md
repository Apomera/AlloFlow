# SLP Outreach Campaign: EXPANDED MATERIALS

## Part 1: Teleprompter-Ready Demo Video Script

---

### VERSION A: 90-Second Word Sounds Demo

```
[OPEN: Screen recording ready, AlloFlow homepage visible]

"What if you could generate eight phonemic awareness activities 
from any text... in thirty seconds?"

[ACTION: Paste a short reading passage into input]

"I just pasted a second-grade reading passage about butterflies."

[ACTION: Click Word Sounds Studio button]

"One click on Word Sounds Studio..."

[ACTION: Show the generated activities appearing]

"...and now I have sound counting, blending practice, 
segmenting with Elkonin boxes, rhyme matching, 
sound mapping, first-middle-last sound isolation, 
sight word practice, and word family exploration."

[ACTION: Click into student view of one activity]

"Each activity has audio support — listen..."

[ACTION: Click play on TTS]

"...adaptive difficulty that adjusts to the student..."

[ACTION: Show XP and badge popup]

"...and gamification that keeps them engaged. 
XP, badges, streaks — they actually want to practice."

[ACTION: Show mastery tracking dashboard briefly]

"And I can see exactly which phonemes they're struggling with. 
Real data. Phoneme-level mastery tracking."

[ACTION: Return to main screen]

"Free to try. No signup required. 
Built by a psychologist who was tired of watching 
educators spend their nights making worksheets by hand."

[END: Show URL clearly on screen]

"Link in bio. AlloFlow dot com."

### VERSION B: 60-Second Short for TikTok/Reels

```
[HOOK - 0-3 sec]

[Screen: Show the 8 activities generating]

"Eight activities. Elkonin boxes. Rhyme matching. 
Blending. Segmenting. All of it."

[PROOF - 30-45 sec]

### VERSION C: 2-Minute School Psych RTI Focus

```
[OPEN]
"I'm Aaron Pomeranz — psychologist, 
and I built this because RTI documentation 
was eating my colleagues alive."

[PROBLEM]
"Here's the thing about Tier 2 and 3 interventions: 
Finding differentiated materials takes hours. 
Then progress monitoring takes more hours. 
Then reporting takes even more hours."

[SOLUTION]
"AlloFlow fixes all three."

[DEMO: Paste text]
"Paste your curriculum text. 
One click — you get leveled reading passages, 
vocabulary activities, comprehension quizzes, 
and phonemic awareness practice."

[DEMO: Show Word Sounds]
"Word Sounds Studio gives you eight activity types 
that adapt to student performance. 
The gamification keeps them engaged."

[DEMO: Show RTI dashboard]
"And here's the part school psychs care about: 
Real-time progress data. 
Mastery by skill. 
Exportable for IEP documentation."

[CLOSE]
"I built this to give time back to educators. 
Try it free. Tell me what's missing."
```

**To SPED Directors:**
> "I'm Dr. Pomeranz, a school psychologist. AlloFlow was designed to reduce educator prep time while providing the progress monitoring data you need for IEP compliance and RTI documentation."
