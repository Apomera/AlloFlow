Sorting builds: critical thinking, compare-contrast skills, and conceptual organization. Items can be: text, images, or mixed. Great for: vocabulary classification, concept differentiation, and assessment. XP rewards for accuracy. Tip: Start with simple binary sorts, advance to Venn diagrams for more nuanced thinking.",

Produces: Approaching (2-3 grades below target), On Grade (target level), and Advanced (1-2 grades above target). All versions preserve: key concepts, essential vocabulary, and core meaning. Differences include: sentence complexity, vocabulary choices, and supporting detail depth. Perfect for: tiered reading groups, heterogeneous classes, and providing choice. Students can self-select their comfort level or teacher can assign. Compare versions to see how the same content adapts. Each version is separately editable after generation.

Supports: multiple languages, punctuation commands (say period, comma, new line), and editing commands (delete that). Dictation requires microphone permission in browser. Quality depends on: microphone quality, background noise, and speech clarity. Real-time transcription shows as you speak. Edit transcribed text normally. Great for: students with motor challenges, reluctant writers, and idea generation. Tip: Speak in complete sentences for better accuracy.",

Side-by-side layout shows: original text on left, adapted version on right, with synchronized scrolling. Benefits: see exactly what changed, understand adaptation patterns, and verify key content is preserved. Students can: compare vocabulary differences, see sentence simplification techniques, and understand how complexity was reduced. Great for: teaching summarization skills, showing students adaptation strategies, and teacher quality review. Compare mode works with any two versions. Toggle between split-screen and overlay views. Tip: Use comparison to teach students how to simplify their own writing.",

Use reset when: you realize your approach was wrong, want to reconsider matches, or need a fresh perspective. Does not penalize score. Items remain in their original positions. Reset is unlimited. After reset, all items are available for new matching attempts. Tip: If many matches seem wrong after clicking Check, reset and approach systematically rather than fixing one at a time.",

Options: 5 minutes (micro-focus, quick warm-up), 15 minutes (short task, early finisher activity), 25 minutes (standard Pomodoro, optimal for sustained attention), 45 minutes (extended work, block schedule). Longer durations earn more XP to reward sustained focus. Research shows: most people lose focus after 25-45 minutes, so take breaks between sessions. After timer ends: celebration animation, XP award, and prompt to log what was accomplished. For younger students, start with shorter durations and build up. The Pomodoro Technique is proven to increase productivity and reduce burnout.",

Settings include: Auto-save frequency (every 1/5/10 minutes or on change only), Storage limit (maximum items before oldest are deleted), Cleanup rules (delete after 30/60/90 days or keep forever), and Sync preferences (cloud or local only). Adjust based on: usage patterns, storage constraints, and privacy needs. More frequent auto-save means less risk of lost work but more storage use. Cleanup rules help manage storage automatically. Cloud sync enables cross-device access but requires connectivity. Export settings for backup. Tip: Set auto-save to every 5 minutes for balance of safety and efficiency.",

When ON (Auto-send): message sends after 1-2 seconds of silence, enables hands-free conversation, and flows naturally like talking. When OFF (Manual): you review transcription before sending, can edit mistakes, and have more control. Auto-send is faster but may misinterpret pauses. Manual is slower but more accurate. For quick questions, auto-send works well. For complex questions or when accuracy matters, use manual. Silence detection adjusts to ambient noise. Tip: Use manual mode when first starting to see transcription accuracy, switch to auto when comfortable.",

Ask questions like Where is the glossary? or How do I change the font? and the AI will: highlight the relevant UI element with a visual spotlight, provide step-by-step instructions, and offer to navigate you there. Perfect for: new users learning the interface, finding hidden features, and reducing training time. The AI understands synonyms—saying vocabulary instead of glossary still works. If a feature requires specific conditions (e.g., content must be generated first), the AI explains prerequisites. Reduces frustration and supports self-directed learning of the tool.",

Range: 5 words (quick practice, ~5 minutes) to 30 words (comprehensive session, ~25 minutes). Consider: attention span (younger = fewer words), skill level (struggling readers need more repetition of fewer words), session type (intervention vs. enrichment). Each word includes: audio pronunciation, phoneme breakdown, AI-generated image, and interactive activities. More words = more variety but longer sessions. Fewer words = deeper practice with each. For RTI Tier 2/3 intervention, 8-12 words with multiple repetitions is typically recommended. Adjust based on student response.",

Range: 1 syllable (cat, dog) to 4+ syllables (hippopotamus). Syllable count correlates with decoding difficulty. 1-syllable words: CVC patterns, beginning readers, phoneme segmentation focus. 2-syllable words: introduce syllable division, compound words, affixes. 3+ syllable words: advanced decoding, morphology awareness. Use with Max Syllables to create specific ranges: set both to 2 for two-syllable practice only. Tip: Progress from fewer syllables to more as students build skills. Multisyllabic word instruction is critical for upper elementary fluency development.",

When ON (default): the Safety Flags column appears in the student table showing flag counts and critical alerts (🚨). When OFF: the column is hidden for a cleaner view.

AI-powered safety checks run on every student message in Socratic Chat, Persona Interviews, and Adventure Mode. Toggle state is saved to localStorage and persists across sessions. Use this to reduce visual clutter when safety monitoring is not your current focus.",
