# Pair Drift Triage — May 12 2026

Output of `node dev-tools/audit_pair_drift.js`, classified by whether each
flagged module represents real risk or audit-tool noise. Use this as a
backlog: each "Real reverse drift" entry is one focused follow-up commit.

## Triage classifications

- **Real reverse drift** — module.js has declarations the source.jsx lacks
  (`mod-only > 0`). The compiled file has been hand-edited; next rebuild
  will clobber those changes. **Action: port the changes back into
  `*_source.jsx`.**
- **Build-transform noise** — `src-only == 0 && mod-only == 0`, declaration
  sets match. The line delta is from esbuild's `React.createElement`
  output being more verbose than the JSX source it compiles from. **No
  action; audit threshold could be tuned later.**
- **Hand-maintained pair** — module.js is hand-edited (no `_build_*.js`
  script exists); `_source.jsx` is a reference snapshot, not the build
  source. The two drift naturally over time and don't pose rebuild risk.
  **Action: either remove the stale source.jsx or write a build script
  if we want the source.jsx to be canonical.**

## Real reverse drift — backlog (0 items remaining)

### 1. `generate_dispatcher` — ✅ Resolved May 12 2026

The audit reported "20 functions in module but not source" — accurate
but understated. The full drift was actually **1,477 lines**: a
793-line audit-pipeline prefix block (`COMMON_LONGER_WORDS`,
`computeReadinessScore`, `computeCognitiveLoad`, `computeContent*`,
`harvestExistingAuditSignals`, etc. — 14 top-level functions + 6
nested helpers + supporting constants) PLUS ~684 lines of edits
sprinkled inside the 2000+ line `handleGenerate` body (Plan S quiz
mode logic, etc.).

**Why the audit understated it:** `audit_pair_drift.js` counts
*top-level declarations*. The handleGenerate body edits are nested
inside an existing top-level function, so they don't change the
declaration count.

**Root cause (matches `feedback_edit_source_not_compiled.md`):**
edits were made directly to `generate_dispatcher_module.js` instead
of `generate_dispatcher_source.jsx`. Most recent example was commit
`ec14da8c` on May 9 ("Fix: add missing computeContentAccessibility +
UDL JSON retry") — 126 lines added to module, 0 to source. The build
script (`_build_generate_dispatcher_module.js`) does work; running it
would have wiped all 1,477 lines of drift.

**Fix:** wholesale body-copy. Source.jsx was overwritten with the
exact contents of module.js between the IIFE header (L1-3) and tail
(L3843-3846). The rebuild produces a module.js that is content-identical
to the pre-port file (verified by md5 with line endings normalized).
No code was lost; source.jsx is now the canonical truth, and future
edits go to source.jsx → rebuild → module.js.

**Auditor learning:** to catch this class of drift in the future,
extend `audit_pair_drift.js` to compare body byte counts of named
functions, not just top-level declaration sets. Documented as a
follow-up in this doc's "Audit-tool follow-up" section.

### 2. `quickstart` — ✅ Resolved May 12 2026

Ported `fetchAndCleanUrl` and `isGoogleRedirect` shims into
`quickstart_source.jsx` (as top-of-file `var` declarations with a sync
note). Also corrected the misleading "Auto-generated" header comment in
`quickstart_module.js` — there's no actual `_build_quickstart_module.js`,
so the comment was misdirecting future agents. Declaration counts now
match (18 ↔ 18, src-only=0, mod-only=0). Residual +233 line delta is
IIFE wrapper boilerplate (matches the build-transform noise pattern).

## `view_pdf_audit` — 1 + 1 declaration mismatch

`src-only=1, mod-only=1` typically means a single function got renamed
in one file but not the other, or the parameter signature changed.
Quick investigation needed to confirm it's not a real drift.

## Hand-maintained pair — `adventure`

`adventure_module.js` doesn't have a matching `_build_adventure_module.js`
build script. `adventure_source.jsx` exists but is a reference copy, not
the build source. The 75-line delta is real but doesn't pose rebuild
risk because there's no rebuild path.

**Decision for a future session:**
- **Option A:** Write `_build_adventure_module.js` and make
  `adventure_source.jsx` canonical (matches the pattern of
  `_build_view_*_module.js` files).
- **Option B:** Delete `adventure_source.jsx` and accept that
  `adventure_module.js` is hand-maintained (matches the pattern of
  `allo_data_module.js`, `firestore_sync_module.js`, etc.).

Adjacent files (`adventure_handlers`, `adventure_session_handlers`) have
build scripts already, so Option A is the more consistent path.

## Idempotency-test workflow (May 12 2026 — discovered the hard way)

For JSX-compiled modules, the body-byte audit reports false positives
on every function whose JSX got compiled to verbose React.createElement
calls. To distinguish FALSE POSITIVE drift (audit-only) from REAL drift
(hand-edits that the build would wipe), run the build script and
**diff before/after**:

```bash
cp X_module.js /tmp/X_before.js
node _build_X_module.js
md5sum <(tr -d '\r' < /tmp/X_before.js) <(tr -d '\r' < X_module.js)
# Identical md5 → false positive (no real drift; safe to commit the rebuild)
# Different md5 → REAL drift; restore module.js from backup and port the
#                 hand-edits to source.jsx, then rebuild
```

**Critical:** always back up FIRST. A rebuild can silently wipe hundreds
of lines of unported hand-edits.

## Module classification by idempotency test (May 12 2026)

Tested all 5 modules the audit flagged for nested-body drift:

| Module | Idempotent? | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `immersive_reader` | ✓ yes | **False positive.** Audit flagged 3 functions (_lazyIcon, handleKeyDown, renderBionicWord) but all are byte-identical logic, just esbuild reformatting. No port needed. |
| `games` | ✓ yes | **False positive.** Audit flagged 3 functions but rebuild produces byte-identical module.js. No port needed. |
| `teacher` | ✗ no | **REAL drift.** Rebuild changed module.js → there are hand-edits that would be wiped. Per-function review required. Restored from backup. |
| `story_forge` | ✗ no | **REAL drift.** Rebuild wiped 116 lines (`128 → 12` diff vs origin). Restored from backup. |
| `view_sidebar_panels` | ✗ no | **REAL drift.** Rebuild wiped 77 lines (`89 → 12` diff vs origin). Restored from backup. |

**Real-drift modules now have specific, scoped work**:

### teacher
Rebuild changed content but full diff not yet inventoried. Audit
previously flagged 2 fn (metricBar src-bigger, alloRestoreFocus +
alloSaveFocus mod-bigger). At least these need per-function manual
diff between source.jsx and module.js → port the mod-bigger changes
back to source.jsx → rebuild + verify clean.

### story_forge
116 lines of hand-edits in module.js missing from source.jsx. Likely
clustered around the audit-flagged 4 fn (aiScoreNum, beatColor,
stopRecording, startRecording) — but the line delta suggests there's
more than what the audit caught.

### view_sidebar_panels
77 lines of hand-edits missing from source.jsx. Audit flagged 3 fn
+ 3 module-only declarations (_lazyIcon, handleMixChange,
handleResetMix). The module-only declarations likely account for
some of the 77 lines.

## Nested-body drift in JSX-compiled modules — May 12 2026 investigation

The auditor's new nested-body detection (added when resolving
generate_dispatcher's 1,477-line drift) surfaces flagged functions in
story_forge, games, immersive_reader, teacher, and view_sidebar_panels.
Investigation showed these are NOT the same shape as generate_dispatcher
and **cannot be resolved by wholesale body-copy**:

- Generate_dispatcher's build script just wraps source.jsx in an IIFE.
  Source-to-module is a 1-to-1 byte copy (plus header/tail). So
  `cp module.js source.jsx` after stripping the wrapper produced an
  identical rebuild.
- JSX-compiled build scripts (games, immersive_reader, teacher,
  story_forge, view_sidebar_panels, etc.) run source.jsx through
  **esbuild** first, transforming JSX → React.createElement calls.
  The module.js has fundamentally different byte content than the
  source.jsx, even when "in sync". Wholesale copy would put
  React.createElement calls into source.jsx where JSX belongs — and
  the next rebuild would re-transform that into uglier React.createElement
  wrappers around the existing calls.
- Mixed-direction drift (source > module AND module > source in the
  same module) is also more common here, requiring per-function
  decisions on which side is canonical.

**Decision: per-function manual review is the right approach.** For
each flagged function:
1. Read source.jsx version (JSX) and module.js version (compiled).
2. Decide which version represents the intended behavior.
3. If module is canonical: port the relevant JSX equivalent to source,
   then rebuild.
4. If source is canonical: just rebuild — module catches up.

Specific findings (May 12 2026, post-MAX-fix audit):
- `story_forge`: 4 fn drift, mixed direction. aiScoreNum + beatColor
  source-bigger (rebuild). stopRecording + startRecording module-bigger
  (port).
- `games`: 3 fn drift, all module-bigger (`scrambleWord` is a
  preamble false positive after MAX — verify; `useHint` + `GameReviewScreen`
  may be real).
- `immersive_reader`: 3 fn module-bigger.
- `teacher`: 2 fn drift, mixed direction (`metricBar` source-bigger;
  `alloRestoreFocus` + `alloSaveFocus` module-bigger).
- `view_sidebar_panels`: 3 fn drift, mixed direction + 3 module-only
  decls (`_lazyIcon`, `handleMixChange`, `handleResetMix`).

These are deferred to follow-up sessions, one module at a time, with
careful manual review per drifting function.

## Audit-tool follow-up (optional)

The audit's body-byte calculation is heuristic (regex-based, not AST).
Known limitations now documented in `audit_pair_drift.js` source:
1. Icon-shim lines (`var X = _icons.X || function(){...}`) don't
   match the function regex, so they get rolled into the previous
   function's span, inflating its "body".
2. MAX(occurrences) handles the build-script preamble duplicate-decl
   case (a function declared twice in module: once in IIFE preamble
   as a small utility, once as the compiled full body).

A future ship could replace the regex pass with @babel/parser AST
walks for accurate per-function byte counts. Until then, the auditor
biases toward false-positive drift, not false-negative — operators
just verify each flagged item.

The auditor flags any non-zero line delta even when `src-only == 0 &&
mod-only == 0`. For esbuild-compiled view modules, this generates
~10 noise rows per audit run. Two ways to quiet it:

1. Lower the "MISSING/REVERSED" threshold to require `src-only > 0 || mod-only > 0` (declaration drift) AND a line delta. Pure line deltas downgrade to a new "BUILD_NOISE" status.
2. Skip auditing modules whose `_build_*.js` is in a known whitelist of esbuild-driven builds.

Option 1 is cleaner. Each esbuild-compiled view would naturally show as
"BUILD_NOISE" and the audit's headline number would stop alarming on
non-issues.

## Verification

After the two "Real reverse drift" items are addressed in follow-up
sessions:

```bash
node dev-tools/audit_pair_drift.js | grep -E "REVERSED|MISSING"
# Should be empty, or only contain rows where src-only == 0 && mod-only == 0
```

After the auditor follow-up (Option 1 above):

```bash
node dev-tools/audit_pair_drift.js | grep -cE "BUILD_NOISE"
# Expected: ~10 rows downgraded out of the warning category
```
