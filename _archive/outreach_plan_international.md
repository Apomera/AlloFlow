## Phase 1: International School Associations (March–May 2026)

### 1A. EARCOS — East Asia Regional Council of Schools

**Why first:** 229 member schools, dedicated Technology strand at conferences, Google Workspace–heavy region.

> **To:** info@earcos.org / Dr. Edward Greene (Executive Director)
> **Subject:** Free AI Classroom Tool — Speaker Submission for EARCOS Teachers' Conference
>
> Dear Dr. Greene,
>
> My name is Aaron Pomeranz. I'm a school psychologist and the creator of AlloFlow, a free, open-source AI classroom assistant that runs inside Google's Gemini Canvas. It was designed to replace $40,000+ in annual SaaS subscriptions (Lexia, Kahoot, Nearpod, Read&Write) with a single, zero-cost tool — with full UI translation into 100+ languages.
>
> I'm writing to inquire about presenting at a future EARCOS Teachers' Conference within the **Technology strand**. My proposed session:
>
> **"$0 Differentiation: How One Free Tool Replaces $40K in EdTech Subscriptions"**
>
> Key points:
> - Live demo of AI-generated leveled text, phonics activities, escape rooms, and adventure mode
> - Feature parity walkthrough vs. Lexia Core5, Kahoot, Nearpod, and MagicSchool
> - Privacy-first architecture: no student accounts, no PII, works with existing Google Workspace
> - Offline HTML bundles for low-bandwidth classrooms
>
> AlloFlow is already used by educators in the U.S. and is fully AGPL-licensed. I'd also welcome the opportunity to connect with member school technology directors who might benefit from a pilot.
>

> Cost Calculator: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/calculator.html
>
> Thank you for your time.

> Best regards,

### 1B. AISA — Association of International Schools in Africa

**Why:** 100+ schools across Africa where SaaS budgets are tightest. Offline bundles are a key differentiator.

> **To:** info@aisa.or.ke
> **Subject:** Free AI Literacy Tool for AISA Member Schools — Transformative Technology Summit
>
> Dear AISA Team,
>
> I'm reaching out about your **Transformative Technology Summit** and the AISA 2026 Conference (November, Nairobi). I've built AlloFlow, a free, open-source AI classroom assistant that I believe is uniquely suited for international schools in Africa.
>
> **Why AISA schools specifically:**
> - **$0 cost** — replaces subscriptions that most member schools can't afford (Lexia: $40/student, Kahoot: $300/teacher, Nearpod: $400/teacher)
> - **Offline HTML bundles** — students can take interactive lessons home on a USB drive, no internet required
> - **100+ language UI** — full interface translation into Swahili, French, Arabic, Amharic, and any other language via AI
> - **No student accounts** — uses fun codenames instead of PII, sidestepping complex data privacy regulations
> - **Runs inside Google Workspace** — if your school uses Google, AlloFlow works immediately
>
> **Featured tools:** 7 phonemic awareness activities, adventure mode RPG, escape rooms, live quiz battles, oral reading fluency assessment, and 280+ features total.
>
> I would love to present at the Technology Summit or connect with member school technology coordinators for a virtual demo.
>
> Website: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/
>
> Best regards,
> Aaron Pomeranz, Ed.S.
> aaron.pomeranz@maine.edu

### 1C. NESA — Near East South Asia Council

> **To:** Maddy Hewitt (Executive Director), nesacenter.org
> **Subject:** Free AI Differentiation Platform for NESA Schools
>
> Dear Ms. Hewitt,
>
> I'm a school psychologist and the developer of AlloFlow, a free, open-source AI classroom assistant. I'm reaching out about the NESA Fall Leadership Conference (October 2026) and your Learning Futures Summit.
>
> AlloFlow replaces $40,000+ in annual EdTech subscriptions with a single free tool that runs inside Google's Gemini Canvas. It includes 280+ features: leveled text generation, phonics activities, interactive games, escape rooms, live sessions, and a complete accessibility suite — all translatable into any language.
>
> For NESA's diverse multilingual schools, the key differentiators are:
> - Full UI localization into Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Farsi, Turkish, and 100+ more
> - RTL language support built in
> - Local-first data architecture (no cloud dependency for student data)
> - Works with existing Google Workspace for Education
>
> I'd welcome the opportunity to present or connect with interested schools for a pilot.
>
> Best regards,
> Aaron Pomeranz, Ed.S. | aaron.pomeranz@maine.edu
> https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/

### 1D. Tri-Association (AASCA / ACCAS / AASSA) — Latin America & Caribbean

> **To:** tri-association.org (conference submissions)
> **Subject:** Free AI Classroom Platform — Speaker Proposal for Educators Conference
>
> Dear Tri-Association Committee,
>
> I'd like to propose a session for your annual Educators Conference on using free, open-source AI tools to eliminate the "differentiation tax" in international classrooms.
>
> **Session: "$0 Differentiation for Every Learner — A Live Demo of AlloFlow"**
>
> AlloFlow runs inside Google Gemini Canvas and generates differentiated lessons, games, quizzes, and phonics activities from any text — in any language. It replaces Lexia, Kahoot, Nearpod, MagicSchool, and Read&Write with zero cost to schools.
>
> I was especially inspired by **Dr. Matt Bergman's** UDL work through the Tri-Association — AlloFlow is built on the same CAST UDL framework, with every feature mapped to UDL principles.
>
> Website: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/

> Best regards,
> Aaron Pomeranz, Ed.S. | aaron.pomeranz@maine.edu

## Phase 3: Research & University Partnerships (Ongoing)

### Draft Email to Dr. Justin Dimmel (UMaine)

> **Subject:** AlloFlow — Open-Source AI Platform for K-8 Differentiated Instruction (Research Partnership)
>
> Dr. Dimmel,
>
> My name is Aaron Pomeranz. I'm a school psychologist and independent EdTech developer in Maine. I'm reaching out because your work on AI in K-12 education aligns directly with a project I believe has significant research potential.
>
> **AlloFlow** is a free, open-source AI classroom assistant that runs inside Google Gemini Canvas. Over three months, it has grown to 280+ features:
>
> - **Word Sounds Studio**: 7 phonemic awareness activities aligned with Orton-Gillingham / Science of Reading, with benchmark probes and RTI monitoring
> - **Adventure Mode**: RPG-style narrative engine with branching choices, D20 dice, and AI scene illustrations
> - **Live Session Platform**: Real-time differentiation, Democracy Mode, Boss Battles, collaborative Escape Rooms
> - **14 native accessibility features** including Immersive Reader, Bionic Reading, and dyslexia fonts
>
> It replaces ~$40,000+/year in per-school SaaS subscriptions at zero cost. No student accounts. No PII.
>
> **What I'm exploring:**
> 1. A controlled pilot comparing AlloFlow-assisted instruction vs. traditional differentiation
> 2. Co-authoring a publication on AI-generated differentiated materials and literacy outcomes
> 3. Joint grant opportunities (IES, NSF, Maine DOE Literacy Hub)
>
> I offer full platform access, technical support, and ongoing development. The platform is AGPL-licensed and self-hostable.
>
> I have a live demo, a [features page](https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/features.html), and YouTube walkthroughs. Happy to give you a 15-minute overview at your convenience.
