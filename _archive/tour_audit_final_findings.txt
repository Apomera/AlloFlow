=== TOUR AUDIT FINAL FINDINGS ===

Summary: Most features claimed in tour descriptions DO exist in the codebase.
The initial automated scan showed false negatives due to naming differences.

## VERIFIED FEATURES (Features claimed that DO exist):

1. **Scaffolds (Step 9)**: ALL features verified:
   - Sentence Frames: scaffoldType, frame type
   - Paragraph Frames: scaffolds_paragraph_frame
   - Checklists & Rubrics: checklist, rubric (87 matches!)
   - AI Auto-Grader: handleAutoGrade, quiz_autograder
   - Live Feedback: instant feedback mentions

2. **Dark Mode (Step 20)**: EXISTS - Uses "theme" system (202 matches)

3. **Persona Features (Step 12)**: 
   - Hot Seat: interview mode exists (74 matches) - "Hot Seat" is a conceptual term for Q&A
   - Debate Mode: debate exists (98 matches) - harmony_label = "Debate Synthesis"
   
4. **Immersive Reader (Step 4)**: ALL features verified:
   - Karaoke Mode: read_along (9 matches), highlighting (10 matches)
   - Focus Reader (RSVP): RSVP exists in title at line 24251
   - Bionic Reading: bionic (8 matches), bold first
   - Grammar Highlighting: grammar (100 matches), parts_of_speech

5. **Export Features (Step 22)**: ALL verified:
   - Print View: print (222 matches), printable (9 matches)  
   - QTI Export: qti (52 matches)
   - HTML Export: downloadHtml (3 matches)
   - Slides Export: pptx (34 matches), PowerPoint (6 matches)

6. **Header Tools (Step 21)**: ALL verified:
   - Tool Icons: icon (217 matches)
   - Status Indicators: indicator (12 matches), badge (84 matches)
   - Keyboard Shortcuts: keyboard (90 matches), shortcut (4 matches)
   - Note: Numbered hotkeys claim (line 27450) may be aspirational - need to verify actual implementation

7. **Version Control (Step 23)**: Partially exists:
   - version (47 matches), compare (46 matches)
   - "Compare different iterations" may be overstated - compare_mode is for text levels, not history iterations


## POTENTIAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

1. **tour-header-tools (Step 21)**: 
   CLAIM: "Keyboard Shortcuts: Use numbered hotkeys to jump between tools rapidly"
   REALITY: Only 1 match for "hotkey" (line 27450, which is the tour description itself)
   STATUS: **POTENTIALLY MISLEADING** - numbered hotkeys may not exist
   
2. **tour-history-panel (Step 23)**:
   CLAIM: "Version Control: Compare different iterations of the same resource"
   REALITY: compare_mode exists but for comparing complexity LEVELS, not version history
   STATUS: **POTENTIALLY MISLEADING** - version comparison may not work as described

3. **tour-tool-persona (Step 12)**:
   CLAIM: "Hot Seat" and "Debate Mode" as distinct features
   REALITY: These are conceptual descriptions of general chat functionality
   STATUS: **ACCEPTABLE** - pedagogical terminology, not UI labels


## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. VERIFY: Check if numbered tool hotkeys actually work (0-9 keys)
2. CLARIFY: If hotkeys don't exist, update tour-header-tools description
3. CONSIDER: Update tour-history-panel to describe actual compare functionality
4. NO ACTION NEEDED: Most other features are accurately described
