## 📧 Email 1: Maine DOE – Tracy Whitlock (Inclusion Coordinator)

**To:** Tracy.W.Whitlock@maine.gov  
**Subject:** Free, Open-Source UDL Tool for Maine Educators – AlloFlow

---

Dear Ms. Whitlock,

My name is Aaron Pomeranz, and I'm a school psychologist (PsyD, University of Southern Maine) and EdTech developer based here in Maine. I'm reaching out because I've developed a free, open-source AI tool called **AlloFlow** that I believe could meaningfully support inclusive education across the state.

**What AlloFlow Does:**  
AlloFlow is a "differentiation engine" that instantly transforms any curriculum into accessible, multi-tiered resources. It runs inside Google Gemini Canvas (no installation required) and includes:

- **Automatic text leveling** (K-12 Lexile adjustment)
- **Multilingual glossaries** with audio pronunciation
- **Built-in accessibility suite** (Dyslexia fonts, Text-to-Speech, Irlen overlays, keyboard-navigable games)
- **Gamified learning modes** (RPG adventures, vocabulary games, Jeopardy-style review)
- **QTI export** for direct Canvas/Schoology integration

The tool is specifically designed around UDL principles—I've mapped every feature to the CAST framework's checkpoints.

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**  
I'm hoping AlloFlow might be a resource worth sharing with Maine educators through your office's communication channels. Because it's completely free (AGPL open-source license) and runs within existing Google Workspace infrastructure, there's no procurement barrier for districts.

I'm also happy to provide a demo, answer technical questions, or connect with district IT staff about privacy considerations (the tool uses a "local-first" architecture designed for FERPA alignment).

- 10-Minute Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mr-VzWHys8

Thank you for your time and for all you do to support inclusive education in Maine. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how AlloFlow might help reduce the "differentiation tax" our educators face.

Warm regards,

## 📧 Email 2: Maine MLTI – Emma-Marie Banks (Learning Through Technology)

**To:** Emma-Marie.Banks@maine.gov  
**Subject:** Open-Source AI Tool for Differentiation – Potential MLTI Resource?

---

Dear Ms. Banks,

I'm Aaron Pomeranz, a Maine-based school psychologist (PsyD, USM) and educational technology developer. I wanted to introduce you to **AlloFlow**, a free, open-source AI classroom assistant I've built that I think could be a valuable resource for Maine's MLTI community.

**The Problem AlloFlow Solves:**  
Teachers tell me they spend 3-5 hours per week manually differentiating lessons. AlloFlow reduces that to minutes by using Google Gemini to automatically generate:

- Leveled text (K-12 reading levels)
- Interactive vocabulary games (Bingo, Memory Match, Crossword)
- Scaffolded quizzes with Canvas/QTI export
- Bilingual side-by-side views for ELL students
- Text-to-Speech with phonics breakdown

**Why It Fits MLTI's Mission:**  
- **Zero installation** – Runs in any browser via Gemini Canvas
- **Works on Chromebooks** – Optimized for Chrome/Edge
- **Safety Shield** – Built-in client-side filters for bullying/self-harm (School-Safe)
- **Privacy-first** – Local-first architecture, no student data stored externally
- **Free forever** – AGPL open-source, no subscriptions

I'm reaching out to ask whether AlloFlow might be appropriate for inclusion in MLTI's resource recommendations or professional learning materials. I'm also available to present at any upcoming MLTI events or webinars if that would be helpful.

- GitHub: https://github.com/Apomera/AlloFlow
- Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mr-VzWHys8

Thank you for your leadership in bringing innovative technology to Maine classrooms. I'd love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions.

Best regards,

## 📧 Email 4: USM School Psychology Program – Dr. Garry Wickerd

**To:** garry.wickerd@maine.edu  
**Subject:** Fellow USM Grad – Free UDL Tool for Student Training?

---

Dear Dr. Wickerd,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Aaron Pomeranz—I'm a graduate of USM's school psychology doctoral program, and I wanted to reach out about a project I've been developing that might be useful for current students.

I've built an open-source AI tool called **AlloFlow** that helps educators instantly differentiate curriculum materials. It's specifically designed around UDL principles and includes features like automatic text leveling, interactive vocabulary games, and a built-in accessibility suite (Text-to-Speech, Dyslexia fonts, etc.).

**Why I'm Writing:**  
I'm wondering if AlloFlow might be a useful resource to share with students in the program—either as a practical tool for their internships/practica, or as a case study in how AI can support inclusive education. I'd be happy to:

- Provide a guest lecture or demo session (virtual or in-person)
- Share the tool with students for use during their training placements
- Discuss the development process as an example of school psychologists expanding into EdTech

The tool is completely free (open-source), runs in any browser, and requires no installation.

**Links:**
- Website: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/
- Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mr-VzWHys8

It would mean a lot to give back to the program that trained me. Please let me know if this sounds like something that might fit into your curriculum.

## 📧 Email 5: EdSurge (Media Pitch)

**To:** tips@edsurge.com  
**Subject:** Story Pitch: School Psychologist Builds Free AI Tool to Democratize Differentiation

---

Dear EdSurge Team,

I'm pitching a story about how a school psychologist with no formal CS background used AI to build a free, open-source classroom tool that's taking on $15K/year commercial EdTech stacks.

**The Hook:**  
I'm Aaron Pomeranz, a school psychologist (PsyD) from Maine. I built **AlloFlow**—a "differentiation engine" that uses Google Gemini to instantly transform static curriculum into leveled texts, interactive games, and accessible resources. The entire 51,000-line application was developed collaboratively with AI, allowing a non-developer to create production-quality software.

**Why This Matters:**
1. **The "Differentiation Tax"** – Teachers spend 3-5 hours/week manually adapting materials. AlloFlow reduces this to minutes.
2. **Open Source Activism** – The tool is free (AGPL license) as a deliberate rejection of EdTech subscription models that drain public school budgets.
3. **AI-Native Development** – The project is a case study in "AI as Lead Developer"—a subject matter expert directing AI to build complex software.

**Potential Angles:**
- How AI is enabling non-developers to build sophisticated tools
- The tension between open-source and commercial EdTech
- Practical AI applications that actually reach classrooms (vs. demos)

**Assets Available:**
- Demo video
- Full source code (GitHub)
- Comprehensive user manual with UDL alignment matrix
- Available for interview

**Links:**
- Website: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/
- GitHub: https://github.com/Apomera/AlloFlow

Happy to provide any additional details. Thank you for considering!

Best,

## 📧 Email 6: Instructional Coach (Generic Template)

**To:** [Instructional Coach Email]  
**Subject:** Quick question about differentiation tools in your district

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I built something I think might save your teachers serious time—and I'd value 10 minutes of your honest feedback.

I'm a school psychologist (not a vendor) who got frustrated watching teachers spend hours manually leveling texts and creating vocabulary games. So I built **AlloFlow**—a free tool that does it in minutes:

- Paste any text → get a 3rd grade version in 10 seconds
- Generate an Escape Room game from quiz questions
- Create bilingual glossaries with audio pronunciation

It runs inside Google Gemini Canvas (no install, no accounts), and it's open-source—meaning free forever.

**Why I'm emailing you specifically:**  
Instructional coaches are the ones who actually know what teachers need. I'm not trying to sell anything—I'm trying to find out if this is actually useful or if I'm missing something obvious.

Would you be open to a 15-minute Zoom where I show you the tool and you tell me what's broken? I'll send you coffee money for your time.

**Quick demo (90 seconds):** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mr-VzWHys8

Either way, thanks for what you do. Coaches are the unsung heroes.

Best,

## 📧 Email 7: Special Education Coordinator/Director

**To:** [SPED Coordinator Email]  
**Subject:** Free ORF check + differentiation tool for SPED teams

---

Hi [First Name],

I know your team is probably drowning in IEP compliance work, so I'll keep this short.

I'm a school psychologist who built a free tool called **AlloFlow** that I think could help your SPED teachers:

**The highlights:**
- **Oral Fluency Check** – Students read aloud, the tool calculates WCPM and shows a color-coded accuracy map. (This usually costs $15-50/student/year—this is free.)
- **Instant Text Leveling** – Paste any grade-level text, get K-12 versions in seconds
- **Built-in Accessibility** – Dyslexia fonts, Text-to-Speech, reading rulers, Irlen overlays
- **Phonemic Awareness Suite** – Includes segmentation/blending tools (replacing expensive standalone apps)
- **Keyboard Accessible** – Full drag-and-drop support for motor-impaired students
- **No PII required** – Designed for FERPA, uses random codenames instead of student names

It's open-source (free forever), runs in any browser, and requires zero installation.

**Why I'm reaching out to you:**  
SPED teachers are the ones who *have* to differentiate—it's literally in the IEP. I want to know if this tool actually helps them or if I'm missing critical features.

Would you or one of your SPED teachers be willing to try it for one unit and give me feedback? I'm not selling anything—just trying to make it useful.

Thanks for everything you do for kids with disabilities.

## 📧 Email 8: ESL/ELL Program Coordinator

**To:** [ESL Coordinator Email]  
**Subject:** Free multilingual differentiation tool for ELL teachers

---

Hi [First Name],

I built a free tool that I think could be a game-changer for your ELL teachers—and I'd love your perspective.

**AlloFlow** is an AI tool that instantly creates:
- **Bilingual side-by-side text views** (any language pair)
- **Multilingual glossaries with audio pronunciation**
- **Real-time group differentiation** (push different language versions to different student groups during live sessions)
- **Full RTL support** for Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, etc.

It runs in Google Gemini Canvas (no installation), and the entire UI can be translated into the student's home language.

**The real differentiator:**  
Teachers can create student groups (e.g., "Spanish Speakers," "Somali Speakers") and push *different* translated resources to each group during the same lesson. I haven't seen any other tool do this.

**What I need from you:**  
I'm not trying to sell anything—it's open-source and free forever. I just want to know if this actually solves problems for ELL teachers, or if I'm missing something.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo? Or if you'd rather just try it yourself: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/

Thanks for supporting our multilingual learners.

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I'm hoping to get a technical review of **AlloFlow**, a free AI differentiation tool I've built for teachers.

**The quick pitch:**
- Runs entirely inside Google Gemini Canvas (no separate app, no installation)
- Uses district's existing Google Workspace auth (no new accounts)
- Local-first data architecture: student work saves as JSON files, not to external databases
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, full keyboard navigation
- Open-source (AGPL v3): https://github.com/Apomera/AlloFlow

**Why I'm contacting you:**
Before I pitch this to instructional coaches in your district, I want to make sure it passes muster with IT. I know you're the gatekeeper—and for good reason.

I'm happy to answer any questions about:
- Data flow and privacy architecture
- API usage (uses Gemini API via Canvas, no external calls)
- FERPA alignment (no PII required or stored)

Would you have 20 minutes to take a look and tell me if this would be blocked by district policy, or if it's something you'd be comfortable recommending?

**Links:**
- Website: https://apomera.github.io/AlloFlow/
- GitHub (full source): https://github.com/Apomera/AlloFlow

## 📧 Email 11: Champion Teacher Request (After Positive Response)

**Subject:** Would you be our first case study?

---

Hi [First Name],

Thanks so much for trying AlloFlow—I really appreciate the feedback!

I have a favor to ask: Would you be willing to be a "champion teacher" for the tool? Here's what that would mean:

**The ask:**
- Use AlloFlow for one unit (2-3 weeks)
- Let me check in once a week (5-10 min) to hear what's working and what's broken
- At the end, give me a 2-3 sentence quote I can use on the website

**What you get:**
- Direct line to me for support and feature requests
- Your feedback actually gets built into the next version
- A small token of appreciation (coffee gift card? classroom supplies? let me know)

No pressure at all—I know your time is precious. But if you're willing, you'd be helping me make the case that this tool actually works in real classrooms.

Let me know either way!

Best,  
Aaron
