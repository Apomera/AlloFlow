## ⚠️ Privacy & FERPA Compliance

AlloFlow is designed to be **FERPA-compatible** with a privacy-first architecture:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Local-First** | Student data is imported/exported as JSON files for local storage |

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep cloud syncing off for maximum privacy. Turn it on only for cross-device resource development.
