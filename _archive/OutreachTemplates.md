## 1. Cold Outreach: District Technology Director

**Subject:** Open-source alternative to your EdTech subscription stack

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I built something that might save your district significant money while improving differentiated instruction.

**AlloFlow** is an open-source platform that combines text leveling, gamified assessment, accessibility tools, and phonemic awareness activities—capabilities typically spread across 5-6 different subscriptions costing $20,000-30,000/year.

It's free. Permanently. Licensed under AGPL (like Linux).

**The pitch:**
- Single HTML file—self-hostable on district infrastructure
- No student accounts required (FERPA-compatible by design)
- No vendor lock-in, no renewal negotiations

I'm looking for 2-3 districts willing to pilot this in a few classrooms. Would you have 15 minutes for a demo?

## 2. Cold Outreach: Curriculum Director / Assistant Superintendent

**Subject:** Differentiation without the subscription fees

---

Hi [Name],

Teachers in your district are probably using 4-5 different tools to differentiate: Diffit for leveling, Kahoot for engagement, Read&Write for accessibility, maybe Amira for reading assessment.

What if one tool did all of that—for free?

**AlloFlow** is an open-source "differentiation engine" that I built as a school psychologist. It generates leveled texts, interactive games, phonemic awareness activities, and accessibility supports from any curriculum content.

It's not "free with a premium tier." It's genuinely open-source—licensed under AGPL, code on GitHub, no investor looking for a return.

I'm piloting with a few districts this semester. Would [District Name] be interested in trying it in 3-5 classrooms?

Happy to schedule a demo or send a video walkthrough.

Best,
Aaron Pomeranz, PsyD

## 3. Warm Outreach: After Conference/Presentation

**Subject:** Following up from [Conference Name]

---

Hi [Name],

Great connecting at [Conference] yesterday. You mentioned [specific challenge they shared—e.g., "struggling to find affordable phonics tools for your K-2 teachers"].

I wanted to follow up with that resource I mentioned: **AlloFlow**.

Here's the quick version:
- Open-source (free forever, no subscription)
- Includes phonemic awareness activities that teachers tell me replace their Heggerty subscriptions
- Runs entirely in-browser, exports offline HTML bundles for homework equity

If you want to try it: https://gemini.google.com/share/a02a23eed0f8

Happy to do a walkthrough with your team if helpful.

Best,
Aaron

## 4. Outreach: Special Education Director

**Subject:** UDL-aligned tool with built-in accessibility (free)

---

Hi [Name],

I'm a school psychologist, and I built AlloFlow specifically because I watched special education teachers spend hours adapting materials that should have been accessible from the start.

**AlloFlow** is an open-source platform with Universal Design for Learning baked in:

- 14 accessibility features (Bionic Reading, OpenDyslexic font, color overlays, TTS with highlighting)
- Automatic text leveling (K-12+)
- Phonemic awareness suite (8 activities with Elkonin boxes)
- Oral reading fluency assessment (WCPM with color-coded feedback)
- Full keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

It's free and open-source. No subscription. No per-student fees.

Would you be interested in piloting this with a few teachers? I'm specifically looking for feedback from special education contexts.

## 5. Outreach: University Professor (Teacher Prep Program)

**Subject:** Free AI tool for your methods course?

---

Hi Professor [Name],

I'm looking for teacher preparation programs willing to introduce pre-service teachers to AI-powered differentiation tools.

**AlloFlow** is an open-source platform I built that combines:
- AI content generation (leveled texts, quizzes, lesson plans)
- Gamified learning (escape rooms, boss battles, adventure mode)
- Accessibility scaffolds (14 UDL-aligned features)

It's free—genuinely open-source under AGPL. Pre-service teachers can use it in their field placements without budget concerns.

If you're teaching a methods course on differentiation, UDL, or EdTech integration, this might be a useful tool to include.

I can provide:
- Guest lecture (virtual or in-person)
- Training materials
- Support during student teaching placements

Would this be relevant for your program?

Best,
Aaron Pomeranz, PsyD

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] - quick video?

---

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note last week about AlloFlow.

I know inboxes are overwhelming—here's a 3-minute video showing the key features: [YouTube link]

If it looks useful, I'd love to set up a pilot. If not, no worries at all.

Best,
Aaron

**Abstract:**
This session introduces AlloFlow, an open-source platform combining AI content generation, gamified assessment, and accessibility scaffolds into a single, self-hostable tool. Attendees will explore:

1. The pedagogical architecture (UDL-aligned design, phonemic awareness integration)
2. The technical approach (single-file deployment, local-first data)
3. The economic model (AGPL licensing, district self-hosting)
4. Live demonstration of key features

Participants will leave with access to the tool and implementation strategies for their contexts.
