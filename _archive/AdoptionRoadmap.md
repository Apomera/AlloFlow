- [ ] Provide 1:1 onboarding sessions (30 min each)
- [ ] Create a private Slack/Discord for pilot teachers
- [ ] Collect weekly feedback and iterate rapidly
- [ ] Document 2-3 "hero stories" (specific teacher wins)

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active teachers | 5-10 |
| Weekly usage sessions | 3+ per teacher |
| NPS score | 50+ |
| Bug reports resolved | <48 hours |

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Video testimonials from 2-3 teachers
- [ ] Case study document with usage data
- [ ] Refined Quick Start Wizard based on friction points

---

## Phase 2: Spark (Months 4-6)
**Goal:** 1-3 school-level pilots with admin buy-in

### Actions
- [ ] Convert teacher champions → school-level referrals
- [ ] Present to building principals (use one-pager + demo)
- [ ] Offer "IT self-hosting walkthrough" to gain technology director trust

| Admin testimonials | 2+ |
| Conference acceptances | 1-2 |

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Self-hosting documentation (for IT departments)
- [ ] Professional development slide deck (90 min session)
- [ ] ROI calculator spreadsheet (input: current subscriptions → output: savings)

## Phase 3: Flame (Months 7-12)
**Goal:** 1 district-level partnership + regional recognition

### Actions
- [ ] Present at 2-3 conferences (ISTE, state-level ASCD, etc.)
- [ ] Pitch to 3-5 district curriculum directors
- [ ] Partner with 1 university teacher prep program
- [ ] Publish usage research (if academic partnership exists)
- [ ] Create "Train the Trainer" materials for district coaches

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| District partnerships | 1-2 |
| Total active teachers | 100-200 |
| University partnerships | 1 |
| Media mentions | 3-5 |

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] District implementation guide
- [ ] Train-the-trainer curriculum
- [ ] Research brief (usage data + teacher survey results)

---

## Phase 4: Spread (Year 2+)
**Goal:** Sustainable growth through network effects

### Actions
- [ ] Establish community contribution guidelines (for code + translations)
- [ ] Recruit 2-3 co-maintainers (reduce bus factor)
- [ ] Create "AlloFlow Certified" badge for trained teachers
- [ ] Apply for education grants (SBIR, foundation funding for sustainability)
- [ ] Explore state-level OER adoption (e.g., state DOE partnerships)

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Districts using | 10+ |
| Total active teachers | 1,000+ |
| GitHub contributors | 5+ |
| Language packs | 10+ (community-contributed) |

## Critical Path Dependencies

```
Teacher champions (5-10)
        ↓
School pilots (1-3 buildings)
        ↓
District partnership (1 district)
        ↓
Conference presentations → More districts
        ↓
University partnership → Pre-service teacher pipeline
        ↓
Community contributors → Sustainability
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Burnout (solo maintainer)** | Recruit co-maintainers early; document everything |
| **Gemini API changes** | Architecture allows swapping LLM backends |
| **Competitor copies features** | Open-source means community can fork; brand = philosophy |
| **District IT resistance** | Lead with self-hosting; show single-file architecture |
| **Teacher overwhelm (too many features)** | Quick Start Wizard; role-based views; AlloBot guidance |

---

## Quick Wins (Do This Week)

1. **Post on Twitter/X** announcing the open-source release with a 60-second demo video
2. **Email 5 teachers you know** with a personal intro
3. **Submit to 1 conference** (ISTE proposals due in fall for next year)
4. **Reach out to 1 education blogger** for coverage
5. **Create a simple landing page** with the $26K comparison front and center

---

## The Long Game

**Year 1:** Prove it works (testimonials, case studies, 100+ teachers)
**Year 2:** Prove it scales (district partnerships, university integration)
**Year 3:** Prove it sustains (community contributors, multiple maintainers)
**Year 5:** Become the default open-source alternative that every district evaluates

*"The goal isn't to beat Kahoot. The goal is to make 'open-source differentiation tool' a category that exists—and to be the obvious leader in it."*
