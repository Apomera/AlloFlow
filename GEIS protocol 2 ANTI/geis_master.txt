Note:  as of March 2025, 2.0 Pro Experimental does not allow documents such as MS Word, Google Docs, or PDF files to be loaded separately.  All information on which these instruction sets is based must be loaded directly into the chat prompt.  PDF files must be converted to Google Docs or MS Word documents before adding these to the instruction set.
