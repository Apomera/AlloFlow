# AlloFlow Marketing Campaign: SLP & Literacy Specialist Outreach

**Campaign Manager: AI Marketing Director**  
**Launch Date: February 2026**  
**Primary Wedge Feature: Word Sounds Studio**

---

## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### The Pitch (30 Seconds)
> "AlloFlow's Word Sounds Studio generates phonemic awareness activities from any text you paste in. Elkonin boxes, sound mapping, rhyme matching, adaptive difficulty — all AI-powered. Teachers get 8 activity types, students get gamified practice with XP and badges. One source text → endless phonics practice."

### Why SLPs?
1. **Budget autonomy** — SLPs often have discretionary spending for therapy tools
2. **Specific pain point** — Phonemic awareness materials are time-consuming to create
3. **Early adopters** — SLPs actively seek evidence-based digital tools
4. **Referral network** — One SLP talks to 20 teachers

### Template A: Cold Outreach (Short)
**Subject:** 8 phonemic awareness activities from any text — 30 seconds

Hi [Name],

I'm a psychologist who built a free tool called AlloFlow that might save you hours of prep.

**What it does:** Paste any text → get 8 phonemic awareness activities (Elkonin boxes, blending, segmenting, rhyme matching, sound mapping, etc.)

**Why you'd care:** No more hunting for materials. Generate activities from your own stories, vocabulary lists, or lesson content.

**Try it free:** [link] (No signup required)

I'd love your honest feedback. What would make this actually useful for your caseload?

— Aaron Pomeranz, PsyD  
Creator, AlloFlow

### Template B: Cold Outreach (Detailed)
**Subject:** Built this for SLPs — would love your feedback

Hi [Name],

I'm a clinical psychologist who spent 75 days building AlloFlow — a free tool to help educators generate differentiated materials instantly.

**The feature I think you'll care about: Word Sounds Studio**

It takes any text and generates:
- Sound counting activities
- First/last/middle sound isolation
- Sound blending games
- Elkonin box segmentation
- Rhyme matching
- Grapheme-phoneme mapping
- Sight & Spell practice
- Word family exploration

Each activity has TTS audio, adaptive difficulty, and gamification (XP, badges, streaks). Students can practice independently; you get mastery tracking.

I built this because I saw too many SLPs spending nights making phonics worksheets by hand.

**Would you try it and tell me what's missing?** [link]

### Template C: Follow-Up (3 days later)
**Subject:** Re: 8 phonemic awareness activities

Hi [Name],

Just bumping this in case it got buried. Happy to do a 10-minute screen share if you'd rather see it in action.

No pressure — I'm genuinely looking for SLP feedback to make this better.
