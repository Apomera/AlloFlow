# Why AlloFlow is Open Source

## The Problem We're Solving

Every year, school districts spend thousands of dollars on educational software subscriptions—one tool for text leveling, another for gamified quizzes, a third for accessibility features, a fourth for translations. When budgets get cut, these subscriptions are often the first to go. The students who lose access are usually the ones who needed the tools most.

Meanwhile, the software itself costs nothing to copy. Once code is written, it can be shared infinitely at zero marginal cost. The subscription fees aren't paying for the software—they're paying for artificial scarcity.

## Our Approach

AlloFlow is released under the **AGPL v3 license**, which means:

- **Free forever.** No subscription fees, no per-seat licensing, no "freemium" upgrade pressure.
- **Transparent.** The code is public. You can see exactly how the AI processes content and how your data is handled.
- **Modifiable.** Districts with technical capacity can adapt the tool to their specific needs.
- **Self-hostable.** Run it on your own infrastructure for complete data sovereignty.

## Why This Matters for Schools

### Equity
A rural Maine district with 200 students has access to the same differentiation tools as a suburban Boston district with 10,000. Budget should not determine which students receive support.

### Sustainability
Grant-funded initiatives often fail when the grant ends. Open-source tools survive because they don't depend on a single funding source. If one contributor stops maintaining the code, others can continue.

### Trust
When software is a black box, you trust the vendor. When software is open, you trust the code. Educators and administrators can verify that the tool does what it claims—no hidden data collection, no opaque algorithms deciding student outcomes.

### Independence
Proprietary tools create dependency. When a vendor changes their pricing, discontinues a product, or gets acquired, schools are left scrambling. Open-source tools belong to the community that uses them.

## The Economic Reality

| What Districts Pay For | Typical Annual Cost | AlloFlow |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Text Leveling (Newsela, Diffit) | $5,000–$10,000 | ✓ Included |
| Gamification (Kahoot!, Gimkit) | $2,000–$5,000 | ✓ Included |
| Accessibility (Read&Write, Immersive Reader) | $3,000–$6,000 | ✓ Included |
| Quiz Export (Canvas integration) | Often bundled | ✓ Included |
| Translation Support | $1,000–$3,000 | ✓ Included |

We're not against commercial software—sustainable businesses build great tools. But differentiation is too important to be gated by budget. Every teacher deserves access to tools that make their job possible.

## What We Ask in Return

Nothing, legally. But if AlloFlow helps your school:

- **Share your experience.** Tell other educators. Write a case study. Present at a conference.
- **Contribute back.** If your district improves the tool, share those improvements with the community.
- **Support the commons.** Consider the open-source alternatives first for future technology decisions.

## A Note from the Developer

I built AlloFlow because I saw the gap between what teachers are asked to do and what they're given to do it with. Differentiation is mandated. Planning time is not.

This tool exists because I believe:

1. **Teachers are craftspeople**, not button-clickers. They deserve tools they can understand and control.
2. **Students shouldn't pay for their district's budget constraints.** Access to learning support is not a premium feature.
3. **Public education deserves public infrastructure.** The roads are free. The libraries are free. The tools for teaching should be too.

AlloFlow is my contribution to that vision. Use it. Share it. Make it better.
