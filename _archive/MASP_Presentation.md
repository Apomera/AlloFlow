# PART 1: OPENING (10 min)
*Use slides for this section*

## 🎤 Welcome & Hook (3 min)
**Say:**
> "Raise your hand if a teacher has ever come to you saying a student 'just won't read.' Now keep your hand up if you suspected the real issue wasn't motivation—it was access."

> "Today I'm going to show you a free tool that transforms any text into accessible, differentiated resources in minutes. No installation. No accounts. No cost."

---

## 🎤 The Problem (2 min)
**Say:**
> "Teachers get one curriculum. Students arrive with vastly different needs. Differentiation takes hours that teachers don't have. And students disengage before the content ever reaches them."

> "What if we could change that equation?"

---

## 🎤 What is AlloFlow? (2 min)
**Say:**
> "AlloFlow is an AI-powered tool built on Universal Design for Learning principles. You put in any topic, text, URL, or document—and it generates adapted texts, glossaries, organizers, quizzes, flashcards, and more."

> "It's not replacing teachers. It's giving them superpowers."

---

## 🎤 Deployment & Privacy (3 min)
**Key points to hit:**
- ✅ Access: Just a link—no download, no installation
- ✅ Modes: Teacher, Student, Parent, Independent Learner
- ✅ Privacy: Browser-based, no accounts required, data stays local
- ✅ Password protection locks Teacher/Parent modes on shared devices
- ✅ JSON student projects force controlled Student Mode experiences
- ✅ Google Education sign-in uses existing managed accounts

**If asked "Is this FERPA compliant?":**
> "No PII is required to use AlloFlow. Data stays on the device unless explicitly synced. For cloud sync, avoid entering student names while it's enabled."

---

# PART 2: LIVE DEMO (35 min)
*Close slides. AlloFlow is your presentation now.*

## 🖥️ Demo Sequence

### Opening AlloFlow (2 min)
**Do:** Navigate to AlloFlow URL
**Say:**
> "This is it. No login screen. No setup wizard. Students see this same interface."

**Do:** Show role selection modal
**Say:**
> "You choose a mode upfront. For students on shared devices, I recommend distributing JSON project files—they automatically load in Student Mode."

---

### Text Adaptation (5 min)
**Do:** Enter a grade-level topic or paste complex text
**Do:** Generate content and show the simplified text

**Say:**
> "Think about that 8th grader reading at a 4th grade level. They need access to grade-level content and concepts, but the original text is a wall. This opens the door without dumbing it down."

**Demo tip:** Toggle between original and simplified to show comparison

---

### Tiered Glossary (4 min)
**Do:** Open the glossary view
**Do:** Click a Tier 2 or Tier 3 term

**Say:**
> "Every term gets a definition, translation, pronunciation, and image. For ELL students and students with language-based learning disabilities, vocabulary is often the first barrier."

**Do:** Click the speaker icon for TTS
**Do:** Show translation dropdown

---

### Accessibility Toolbar (5 min)
**Do:** Open the accessibility settings (Type icon in header)

**Say:**
> "These aren't hidden in a settings menu. They're right here, always available."

**Demo each briefly:**
- [ ] OpenDyslexic / Lexend font
- [ ] Bionic reading toggle
- [ ] Text size slider
- [ ] Line height adjustment
- [ ] Color overlay

**Say:**
> "Students can self-select what works for them. That's UDL in action—we're not deciding for them, we're giving them options."

---

### Visual Organizers (4 min)
**Do:** Generate a graphic organizer from the text

**Say:**
> "For students with executive function challenges, visual structure is essential. This takes 30 seconds to generate versus 30 minutes to create by hand."

**Demo tip:** Show that it's exportable/printable

---

### Interactive Activities (5 min)
**Do:** Show one or two of these:
- [ ] Flashcards
- [ ] Quiz (show different question types)
- [ ] Word game (Crossword or Bingo)

**Say:**
> "For students who need repetition without boredom. The variety keeps engagement high."

**Optional - if time permits:**
**Do:** Briefly show Adventure Mode
**Say:**
> "This embeds academic content in a narrative story. Great for motivation and engagement."

---

### Text-to-Speech (3 min)
**Do:** Highlight text and trigger TTS
**Do:** Show karaoke-style word highlighting

**Say:**
> "Natural AI voices with word-level highlighting. Students can follow along, adjust speed, and replay sections."

---

### Quick Feature Callouts (5 min)
Depending on audience interest, briefly show:
- [ ] Quiz with boss battle mode (gamification)
- [ ] Flashcard export to printable PDF
- [ ] Standards alignment lookup
- [ ] Translation to other languages
- [ ] Focus mode / reading ruler

---

### Connecting to Use Cases (2 min)
**Say:**
> "Now think about the students you work with..."

| If you support... | Show them... |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Dyslexia | Fonts, TTS, bionic reading |
| ELL | Translations, glossary, audio |
| ADHD | Focus mode, chunked content, games |
| Processing delays | Slowed TTS, simplified text |
| Anxiety | Predictable interface, self-pacing |
| Autism | Visual organizers, clear structure |

---

# PART 3: HANDS-ON (8 min)

**Say:**
> "Your turn. Open AlloFlow on your device. Think about one student you work with—or one topic teachers struggle to differentiate. Try generating something for them."

**Do:** 
- Walk around the room
- Answer questions
- Help anyone stuck
- Note common questions for Q&A

---

# PART 4: WRAP-UP (7 min)

## 🎤 Key Takeaways (2 min)
*Can project a slide here, or just say it*

**Say:**
> "Three things to remember:
> 1. AlloFlow transforms any content into accessible resources—free, no installation
> 2. It operationalizes UDL without adding to teacher workload
> 3. You can recommend it today. There's no barrier to trying it."

---

## 🎤 Your Role (2 min)
**Say:**
> "As school psychologists, you're often the bridge between 'this student is struggling' and 'here's a tool that can help.' AlloFlow is something you can mention in:
> - Teacher consultation
> - IEP/504 meetings
> - Parent conferences
> - Your own assessment sessions"

---

## 🎤 Q&A (3 min)
**Common questions and answers:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "Is student data stored?" | No accounts required. Data stays local unless explicitly exported. |
| "Can this replace reading intervention?" | No—it's an access tool, not a curriculum. Use alongside intervention. |
| "Does it work on Chromebooks?" | Yes, fully browser-based. |
| "Can students use it independently?" | Yes, Student Mode has built-in guardrails. |
| "Is it FERPA compliant?" | No PII required. Data stays local. No FERPA concern for typical use. |
