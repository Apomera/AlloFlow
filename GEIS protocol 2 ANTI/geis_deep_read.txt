[Child] is referred by Child Development Services - York Case Manager Laura Dubois for psychological evaluation as he exhibits a high activity level, short attention span, wanders about the classroom, and rushes through activities. His educational team questions whether [Child] exhibits attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
[Child] is referred by Child Development Services - York Service Coordinator Lori Alexander for psychological evaluation of possible autism spectrum disorder. Screening with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers indicates that [Child] exhibits several characteristics suggestive of autism spectrum disorder, warranting further evaluation.  He uses limited functional communication, does not respond to his name, and often prefers to play independently.
[Child] is referred by Child Development Services - York Case Manager Kiley Monsalvez for psychological evaluation as [Child] displays extreme rigid adherence to routines, has difficulty sustaining attention, and displays heightened emotional reactivity.  [Child] was hit by a previous daycare provider in the fall of 2022, following which she displayed very heightened anxiety and emotional reactivity.

=== 18 MCP IS ASEBA 45 (Pro).docx ===
Write a summary based on information in the attached ASEBA summary document, which will be included in a psychological evaluation report.
Writing style:  
Professional Writing Style: Write in a professional, clear, and objective manner, avoiding jargon and explaining technical terms when necessary.  Use vocabulary and sentence structure that is understandable to the average reader but professional and clear.
Referencing adults: the adult is to be referred to by their  relationship to the child (for example, [Child]ΓÇÖs teacher, mother), or by title and last name (for example, Ms. Davis, Mr. Evans, Dr. Jones).
Phase 1:  Writing Content:  For each section:
Using the scale description (in lowercase), write a sentence that reports the childΓÇÖs level on the scale.   
Always list the scale percentile rank in parentheses after each syndrome scale score description.   
The description of parent ratings should usually precede teacher ratings.  
The Child Behavior Checklist is usually filled out by the parent, so please indicate this with a sentence stem like one of the following:
 ΓÇÿ[Ms./Mr. parent] rates [Child] as demonstrating [level]ΓÇªΓÇÖ
 ΓÇÿHis [parentsΓÇÖ, motherΓÇÖs, fatherΓÇÖs] ratings indicate that [Child] exhibits [level] ΓÇªΓÇÖ 
ΓÇÿAt home, [Child] displays [level] ΓÇªΓÇÖ 
The Caregiver-Teacher Report Form is usually filled out by the teacher or another caregiver, so please indicate this with a sentence stem like one of the following:
ΓÇÿTeacher ratings indicate that [Child] exhibits [level] ΓÇªΓÇÖ 
ΓÇÿAt school, [Child] displays [level] ΓÇªΓÇÖ  
If the T-score for either the Child Behavior Checklist or the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form is greater than 60, describe up to but no more than 4 examples of scale item endorsements from the associated scale, choosing from the top of the list.  Do not include these examples in quotation marks. 
Vary the language somewhat when listing endorsed items, using different sentence stems such as 
ΓÇÿIn this regard, [Child] ΓÇªΓÇÖ
ΓÇÿFor example, [Child] ΓÇªΓÇÖ
ΓÇÿExamples include that [Child]ΓÇªΓÇÖ
 If the T score is less than 60, do not include examples of endorsed items.  
Phase 2:  Refine writing: 
In each section, examine the text and identify opportunities to combine related sentences into more complex structures. 
Pay attention to the context and relationships between sentences. Your goal is to improve the readability and flow of the text while maintaining the original meaning. 
Use conjunctions, relative clauses, and other grammatical techniques to create complex sentences that connect ideas logically. For example,  ΓÇÿParent ratings indicate that [Child] exhibits mildly elevated attention problems (92nd percentile). He often cannot sit still, is restless, or hyperactive.  He often has difficulty concentrating or paying attention.  Teacher ratings indicate that [Child] displays mildly elevated attention problems (96th percentile).  At school, [Child] often cannot sit still, is restless, or hyperactive.  He often has difficulty concentrating or paying attentionΓÇÖ should be revised to ΓÇÿParent and teacher ratings indicate that [Child] exhibits mildly elevated attention problems (92nd and 96th percentiles, respectively).  [Child] is rated as having frequent difficulty sitting still, is restless and hyperactive, and often has difficulty concentrating or paying attention at home and school.  
Place a blank line between each section.
Sections:
Under the heading ΓÇÿAttention:ΓÇÖ, write a brief paragraph that summarizes information from the Attention Problems Scale from both the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist and the Achenbach Caregiver-Teacher Report Form.  In this section, if a score is in the average range, phrase the sentence to state this in a form like ΓÇÿΓÇª[Child] exhibits no more than average attention problems compared to other children [his/her] age.ΓÇÖ
Under the heading ΓÇÿConduct:ΓÇÖ, write a brief paragraph that summarizes information from the Aggressive Behavior Scale from both the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist and the Achenbach Caregiver

Do not reference the evaluator by name.  
If there is sufficient information, make a prediction of the degree to which testing represents the child's optimal performance based on their ability to participate and attend, understanding of instructions, cooperation, engagement, and joint attention.
If testing was conducted: 
create a heading, ΓÇ£Test Results:ΓÇ¥ and insert a blank line
write a separate paragraph describing the childΓÇÖs performance on each test.  
Reference the test either by what the test measures or the test name.
Describe the test results using the performance terms from Table 1 below, listing the percentile value associated with the childΓÇÖs score, and describing what the test measures as listed in Table 2 below
If the test contains one or more indexes or domains for which there are scores, describe the result using the performance term from Table 1 based on the childΓÇÖs score, followed by the associated percentile value in parentheses, and a description of what the index or domain measures as listed in Table 2.  Do not include the name of the index or domain.  
If there are subtests for which there are scores but these are not associated with a scored index, also include these by reporting the performance term from Table 1 based on the childΓÇÖs score, the percentile value associated with the childΓÇÖs score in parentheses, and a brief description of subtest as listed in Table 2, but do not include the name of the subtest.  
If there are ability or achievement test results from tests that are not included in Table 2, report these in a similar manner, including the name of the test, the performance term from Table 1 (above) based on the childΓÇÖs score, the percentile value associated with the childΓÇÖs score in parentheses, and a brief description of what the test measures based on Gemini Enterprise search results. 
Examples: Use the following examples for style and organizational guidance only. Do not reproduce the specific content of these examples.
Example 1:  On the Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Emma exhibits average cognitive abilities overall, 32nd percentile. Emma demonstrates average verbal comprehension, 47th percentile.

AI Prompt for Generating a Draft IEP
Role: You are an expert AI assistant specializing in special education. Your task is to act as a virtual case manager's aide.
Goal: Generate a comprehensive, well-structured, and data-driven draft of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) based on the provided psychological evaluation report and any other relevant documents (e.g., teacher interviews, previous IEPs). The output should be a scaffold that a case manager can easily review, edit, and finalize.
Input:
Primary Document: .[Psychological evaluation]
Supporting Documents (Optional): [other relevant documents, such as teacher interviews, work samples, or prior progress reports.]
Instructions for IEP Generation:
Based only on the information provided in the documents, create a draft IEP with the following sections. Use clear headings for each section.
1. Student Profile & Eligibility
Student Information: Extract the student's name, date of birth, age at evaluation, and grade.
Primary Disability Category: Based on the evaluation's summary and diagnostic impressions, identify the most likely primary disability category under IDEA (e.g., Autism, Specific Learning Disability, Other Health Impairment). State the key evidence from the report that supports this eligibility.
2. Present Levels of Academic Achievement and Functional Performance (PLAAFP)
Synthesize all relevant data from the evaluation (background history, behavioral observations, standardized test results, and summary) into a holistic narrative.
Organize the PLAAFP into the following domains, creating a comprehensive picture of the student's strengths and needs in each area:
Academic Skills: (Reading, Writing, Math, etc., based on achievement testing like WJ-IV or WIAT).
Cognitive Profile: (Based on cognitive testing like WISC-V or WPPSI-IV, describing processing speed, working memory, verbal comprehension, etc.).
Social-Emotional & Behavioral Functioning: (Describe peer interactions, emotional regulation, and any behavioral patterns noted in the report or rating scales like the BASC-3).
Communication Skills: (Detail receptive, expressive, and pragmatic language abilities from tests like the CELF-5 or as described in observations).
Adaptive/Functional Skills: (Daily living skills, self-care, and independence, based on scales like the Vineland or ABAS).
Motor Skills: (Fine and gross motor abilities, based on tests like the Beery VMI or observational notes).
For each domain, begin with a statement of the student's strengths before detailing the areas of need. Cite specific data points (e.g., standard scores, percentile ranks, age-equivalents) from the report to support every statement.
3. Annual Goals
Based directly on the needs identified in the PLAAFP, generate 3-5 measurable annual goals.
Ensure each goal is a SMART goal:
Specific: Clearly defines the skill to be learned.
Measurable: Includes a metric for success (e.g., "in 4 out of 5 opportunities," "with 80% accuracy," "for 3 consecutive turns").
Achievable: Is realistic for the student within one year.
Relevant: Directly addresses a critical need identified in the evaluation.
Time-bound: To be achieved by the end of the IEP cycle.
Format each goal clearly (e.g., "By [Date], when given [Condition], [Student] will [Behavior] with [Mastery Criteria] as measured by [Data Collection Method].").
4. Accommodations & Modifications
Generate a comprehensive list of recommended accommodations based on the student's learning profile and the evaluator's recommendations.
Organize the accommodations into logical categories for clarity:
Presentation Accommodations (e.g., visual aids, audiobooks, repeated directions).
Response Accommodations (e.g., use of keyboard, speech-to-text, extended time).
Setting Accommodations (e.g., preferential seating, small group testing, sensory breaks).
Timing/Scheduling Accommodations (e.g., frequent breaks, advance notice of changes).
5. Special Education & Related Services
Based on the profile of needs,
