# AlloFlow "Kill Features"
## The Capabilities That Make Adoption a No-Brainer

These are the features that—when demonstrated—should end budget discussions.

---

## Tier 1: "We're Paying HOW MUCH for This?"

These features directly replace expensive specialist software. The ROI argument is trivially easy.

### 1. Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) Assessment
**Replaces:** Amira ($15-50/student), Literably ($12-30/student)

- Record student reading aloud
- Automatic WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute) calculation
- Color-coded word-by-word feedback (correct, hesitation, missed)
- Assessment history saved locally

**The Demo:** Have a student read for 60 seconds. Show the instant feedback. Calculate: "If you have 400 students, that's $6,000-$20,000/year you just saved."

---

### 2. Phonemic Awareness Suite (Word Sounds)
**Replaces:** Heggerty ($500-1,500/school), Really Great Reading ($1,000+)

- 8 activities: Counting, Isolation, Blending, Segmentation, Rhyming, Orthography, Mapping, Family Builder
- Teacher curation panel (fix AI-generated phonemes before lesson)
- Adaptive difficulty (CVC → CCVC → Blends)
- Elkonin boxes for sound-letter mapping

**The Demo:** Generate phoneme activities from *any* vocabulary list in 30 seconds. Show the teacher review panel.

---

### 3. Accessibility Suite
**Replaces:** Read&Write ($8-15/student), Texthelp licenses

- Text-to-Speech with sentence highlighting
- Bionic Reading (bold word starts)
- OpenDyslexic and Lexend fonts
- Color overlays (Irlen support)
- Reading ruler
- Syllabification

**The Demo:** Toggle each accessibility feature in front of a special education coordinator. Watch their eyes widen.

---

## Tier 2: "Wait, It Does THAT?"

These features don't have direct competitors—they're unique to AlloFlow.

### 4. Live Group Differentiation
**No competitor offers this.**

During a live session, push *different resources* to *different groups* with one click:
- Spanish-translated article → ELL group
- Simplified DOK-1 quiz → Tier 3 intervention group
- Advanced extension → Accelerated group

**The Demo:** Create 3 groups. Push 3 different resources. Show how all screens update simultaneously.

---

### 5. Democracy Mode (Adventure)
**No competitor offers this.**

Students vote on story decisions in real-time. Majority wins. Story branches accordingly.

**The Demo:** Run a 5-minute adventure with a class. Show the voting mechanic. Explain: "This is the Socratic method, gamified."

---

### 6. Self-Hosting (Single HTML File)
**No competitor offers this.**

Download the app as one `.html` file. Host it on district servers. No vendor. No external database. Complete data sovereignty.

**The Demo:** Download the file. Open it locally. Show it works fully offline. Say: "Your IT department owns this. Forever."

---

## Tier 3: "This Is Just Better"

These features exist in competitors but are materially superior in AlloFlow.

### 7. Blueprint Mode (Lesson DNA)
**Competitors:** MagicSchool has 80 separate tools. None of them talk to each other.

AlloFlow's "Golden Thread":
- Define topic once
- AI proposes coherent lesson structure
- User approves/edits plan
- Batch-generate 12+ resources with shared vocabulary and context

**The Demo:** Generate a full resource pack in one click. Show how the Quiz uses the same vocabulary as the Glossary and Adventure.

---

### 8. Offline HTML Bundles
**Competitors:** Kahoot, Quizizz require internet. Nearpod requires internet.

AlloFlow exports a complete lesson—text, games, TTS, images—as a single `.html` file that works offline.

**The Demo:** Export a lesson. Turn off WiFi. Open the file. Show everything works. Say: "For the student without home internet, this is everything."

---

### 9. QTI Export
**Competitors:** MagicSchool exports to Google Forms. Kahoot exports nothing.

AlloFlow exports quizzes in QTI format—directly importable into Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard.

**The Demo:** Generate a quiz. Export to QTI. Import into Canvas. Show it becomes a graded assignment.

## Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Free sounds too good to be true." | "It's open-source. Like Wikipedia, Linux, or Firefox. The code is public. There's no hidden cost." |
| "What about support?" | "The documentation is comprehensive. For district pilots, I offer direct onboarding." |
| "What if you disappear?" | "The code is on GitHub. Any developer can maintain it. That's the point of open source." |
| "Our teachers already know Kahoot." | "AlloFlow includes Kahoot-style games AND everything else. Teachers don't have to switch—they can expand." |
| "We need enterprise features (SSO)." | "For self-hosted deployments, your existing Google/Microsoft SSO applies. The app runs in their authenticated browser." |

*These are the features that make the sale. Lead with Tier 1 (cost replacement), dazzle with Tier 2 (unique capabilities), close with Tier 3 (just better).*
