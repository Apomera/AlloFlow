TEMPLATE A: PRIMARY OUTREACH
Subject: Help Us Improve a Free Learning Tool — Looking for Families to Try AlloFlow!

---

Dear Families,

I am developing an educational tool called AlloFlow and I am looking for parents and children who would be willing to try it out and share their feedback.

AlloFlow is an all-in-one learning platform designed to support children across multiple areas. It is not just a reading app. Here is what children can do with it:

Reading and phonics — interactive activities for sound awareness, blending, segmenting, rhyming, and fluency practice with real-time feedback.

Writing and text creation — tools that help children generate, edit, and work with text at their level.

Vocabulary and word study — glossary builders, word games, spelling challenges, and vocabulary activities tied to content they are actually learning.

Math and problem solving — activities and practice tools that adapt to your child's level.

Social-emotional learning — a digital wellness space with mindfulness tools, conflict resolution activities, and a culturally responsive parenting resource hub.

Games and adventures — a story-driven adventure mode and educational mini-games that make practice feel like play, with achievements and progress tracking along the way.

The tool includes a friendly AI guide called AlloBot that helps your child navigate, gives encouragement, and adjusts to their pace. Everything is designed to meet children where they are, whether they need extra support or are ready for a challenge.

What I am looking for:

I need families to try AlloFlow for a few sessions at home and tell me what works, what does not, and what would make it better. Your child's experience will directly shape how the tool develops. This is a real chance to influence something built for kids and families.

Is it free?

Yes, for most families it costs nothing. If your child has a school Google account (the kind provided by your school district), AlloFlow works at no cost through Google's education services.

If you prefer to use a personal Google account, AlloFlow runs through Google Gemini, which has affordable subscription options:

Google AI Plus is about $8 per month and provides full access. This is the plan most families would use.

Google AI Pro is about $20 per month and includes extended features and more storage.

There is also a free tier with basic access if you want to explore before committing.

How to get started:

Visit AlloFlow at [link] on any device with a web browser, whether that is a computer, tablet, or phone. Your child picks a fun codename to use instead of their real name, and they can start exploring right away.

A note about privacy:

No real names are required. Children choose a codename and that is all the tool uses to identify them. Progress data stays on your device or is saved as a file you control. Nothing is collected or stored by us.

I am happy to answer any questions, walk you through the tool, or help you get set up. Just reply to this email or reach out at [contact info].

Thank you for considering this. Your feedback will make a real difference.

Warm regards,
Aaron Pomeranz
Creator, AlloFlow

It works on any device with a browser. It is free with a school Google account, or about $8 a month with a personal Google account through Google AI Plus. Kids use a fun codename instead of their real name, and no personal data is collected.

Hi [Name],

Just checking in to see if you were able to try AlloFlow with your child. I would love to hear:

1. What did your child think of it?
2. Was anything hard to set up or confusing?
3. What feature or subject area would you most want to see improved or added?

Even a one-sentence reply would be incredibly helpful. No pressure at all.

Thanks again,
Aaron
