COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTION AUDIO GAP ANALYSIS
============================================================

1. ACTIVITY INSTRUCTION COVERAGE:
  [OK] counting: map_key=inst_counting, in_bank=True
  [MISSING] isolation: map_key=(not mapped), in_bank=False (not in INST_KEY_MAP, uses dynamic ISOLATION_AUDIO)
  [OK] blending: map_key=inst_blending, in_bank=True
  [OK] segmentation: map_key=inst_segmentation, in_bank=True
  [OK] rhyming: map_key=inst_rhyming, in_bank=True
  [OK] orthography: map_key=inst_orthography, in_bank=True
  [PARTIAL] mapping: map_key=(not mapped), in_bank=True (not in INST_KEY_MAP, bare key 'mapping' exists in bank)
  [OK] spelling_bee: map_key=inst_spelling_bee, in_bank=True
  [OK] word_scramble: map_key=inst_word_scramble, in_bank=True
  [OK] missing_letter: map_key=inst_missing_letter, in_bank=True
  [OK] sound_sort: map_key=inst_word_families, in_bank=True (shares word_families audio)
  [OK] letter_tracing: map_key=inst_letter_tracing, in_bank=True (uses chained audio segments)
  [OK] word_families: map_key=inst_word_families, in_bank=True
