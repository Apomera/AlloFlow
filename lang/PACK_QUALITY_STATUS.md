## Summary of 2026-05-26 cleanup work

| Pack | Before | After | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

| 46 other packs | Generally clean | Audited, no major issues | ✓ |

**Total replacements across this session:** ~30,000+ word substitutions
plus 1,331 differentiated help_mode tooltips.

## Polish — 58.9% Cyrillic contamination cleaned (14 commits)

**Original state:** Built via Russian → Polish substitution dictionary
at commit `cba41c51`. 83.7% of keys (8,339 of 9,965) contained mixed
Russian + Polish text, with 214,954 stray Cyrillic characters.

**Current state:** Cleaned over 14 commits 2026-05-26
(861fd209 through a2b02a0a):
- Contaminated keys: 8,339 → 4,968 (40% fully cleaned)
- Cyrillic characters: 214,954 → 88,303 (58.9% removed)
- High-visibility surfaces (common, modals, help_mode) clean
- ~1,400 Russian→Polish word mappings applied
- ~250 mixed-script suffix patterns fixed (opisм→opisem, uczeńов→uczniów)
- 14 stub-string rewrites covering ~895 keys at once

Remaining work: long-tail vocabulary in tour/toast/behavior_lens/stem
body text. Future sessions can continue dictionary expansion.

## Russian / Polish help_mode — differentiated by feature (1,331 keys)

**Before:** 84-85% of help_mode keys (715 of 796) collapsed to 12
generic stub strings ("Element interfejsu. Wskazówka..." or
"Элемент управления интерфейса..." repeated for unrelated tooltips).

**After (commit a575d117):** Feature-aware tooltips that name the
specific feature category. Distinct value counts went from 76 → 255.

Examples:
- `help_mode.glossary_edit` → "Edytuj ten element." / "Редактировать этот элемент."
- `help_mode.persona_panel` → "Panel postaci." / "Панель персонажа."
- `help_mode.history_save_student` → "Zapisz historii." / "Сохранить истории."

This is not full hand-translation (which would need 715 unique tooltips
written from English source), but it's a substantial step up from 12
generic templates. Users now see what feature category each tooltip is
about even without full prose.

## Persian/Farsi/Dari — Arabic contamination cleaned (3 rounds)

**Approach:** Built confident Arabic → Persian dictionaries from common
words (إنشاء→ایجاد, جميع→همه, يمكن→می‌تواند, etc.) plus prepositions,
verbs, and educational vocabulary.

**Commits:** `882585ba`, `bac96f0a`, `8ddf70b5` (Arabic-script round 3
which covered all 4 packs)

- Farsi: ~6,200 total replacements (1,342 round 1 + 5,518 round 2 + 671 round 3 / 2)
- Dari: ~6,200 total replacements (identical to Farsi — 88% same content)
- Common UI clean (ذخیره for save)
- Tour/toast body text substantially cleaner

Note: `lang/persian.js` does not exist — Persian is served via Farsi/Dari
slugs in the language matcher.

## Urdu — Arabic contamination cleaned (3 rounds, ~4,820 replacements)

**Commits:** `733e9521`, `add30889`, `8ddf70b5`

- Common buttons clean (محفوظ کریں, منسوخ کریں, تصدیق کریں)
- Toast/tour body text substantially cleaner
- Better translations: "براہ کرم اسے کمپریس کریں" instead of Arabic
  "يُرجى ضغطه"; "میگا بائٹ" instead of Arabic transliteration

## Pashto — Arabic contamination cleaned (3 rounds, ~4,240 replacements)

**Commits:** `c5629df8`, `80876802`, `8ddf70b5`

- Common buttons clean (خوندي کول for save, لغوه کول for cancel)
- Body text uses Pashto vocabulary (ټول for all, کولی شي for can,
  ډېر for very, لطفاً for please)

## Japanese — help_mode is unique-per-key, not stubbed (verified)

Initially flagged as having 712 abbreviated stubs, but on closer
inspection Japanese help_mode has 795 distinct unique values — they're
just naturally concise in Japanese style ("ライティングトーン" = "Writing
tone"). Source-vs-translation length ratios that looked suspicious are
legitimate Japanese density, similar to Chinese compactness.

**Status:** No fix needed for help_mode. Some tour text remains
abbreviated (e.g., `tour.analysis_text` 53 chars vs 1173 source), but
those reflect intentional content trimming.
